# Learnable-Task-10
Learnable task 10 on TypeScript. The task is to create a to-do list using typescript. In this repo is code for a to-do list application for PLAW's Master Schedule App. It has a simple readline interface for users to input their tasks' details and due date. It has other functions for completing a task, removing a task, viewing all tasks, clearing all completed tasks, and exiting. In this repo is also the javascript file for my work. So as to take the stress off you from going through a process that's already done. Happy Browsing! Thank youuuuu
